First, make sure you downloaded the `tidyverse` and are able to load it. Furthermore, you need to install the `palmerpenguins` package to access.

```{r load_libs}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Have a look at the class and structure of the `penguins_raw` data set. Also, make yourself familiar with the columns. Since the data set is part of a package, you can also use the corresponding help page. 

```{r class} 
# Insert code here



# End
```

Next, for easier data handling, clean the column names by removing all white spaces and special characters (e.g., brackets, units, ...). 

```{r names}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Now, remove all rows that don't have a measure for stable isotopes (both Delta 15 N and Delta 13 C). Save this into a new `tibble`.

```{r dropna}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Filter the data set to include only the 50% smallest individuals in terms of body mass. Select the individual id, species, the culmen dimensions and the sex columns.

```{r filter}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Create a new column (`culmenclass`) in which each male individual with a culmen length larger than 50 mm is identified by `1`, each female individual with a culmen length larger than 45 mm is identified by `2`, and all other individuals are identified by `0`.

```{r casewhen}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Calculate the min, mean, and max value for each of this new classified groups and calculate the relative number (%) of individuals within each group.

```{r groupby}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Reshape the data from wide to long using the relative number, min, mean, and max as new value column. The name of the new column specifying the information should be `type`, the new cloumn containing the values should be `measurements`.

```{r privot}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Finally, save the resulting `tibble` on your disk (e.g., your desktop) as a .csv file.

```{r writecsv, eval = FALSE}
# Insert code here



# End
```
