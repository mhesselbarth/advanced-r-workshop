Make sure you can install and load all packages. This includes `terra` and `sf`, but also the `tidyverse`.

```{r load_libs}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Next, go to [https://www.naturalearthdata.com](https://www.naturalearthdata.com) and download the "Small scale data, 1:110m" > "Cultural" > "Admin 1 â€“ States, Provinces" data set. Additionally, download the 
"NLCD 2019 Land Cover (CONUS)" data set from [https://www.mrlc.gov](https://www.mrlc.gov). 

Once you downloaded all the data, read it into your R Session using the corresponding packages.

```{r read}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Make sure both the vector and the raster data have the same CRS (Hint: It's often faster to project vectors instead of raster. If projecting the raster, have a look at the 'method' argument).

```{r crs}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Next, remove Alaska and Hawaii from the states vector because there is no NLCD data for these states. Next select only the 5 largest states in area

```{r states_size}
# Insert code here



# End
```

First plot the NLCD data and add the largest states to the map. Try to use the region as shape fill.

```{r plot}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Now, pick one state (your home state, a state you recently visited, a state you want to visit, ...) and get the NLCD data for that state only.

```{r crop}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Next, get all values of the cropped NLCD data and remove all `NA` and `NaN` values. Calculate the relative amount of all remaining values. Which one is the most dominant land-cover class in your state?

```{r rel_class}
# Insert code here



# End
```

Last, try to reclassify the raster into less classes (e.g., use the bigger classification found at[NLCD classes](https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-class-legend-and-description))

```{r classification}
# Insert code here



# End
```
